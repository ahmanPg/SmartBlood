Problems Solution and Scope:

The Scope of the project is that in a very short span it provides user with many facilities. It provides an elegant management of blood, list of hospitals and reliable donor. We want to build a network of people who can help each other during an emergency
The main purpose of this project is to interconnect hospital, donors and needy into a single network , which do validation and store various data and information of blood and health of each individual.
This system is aimed to store data over centralize server consisting of database where the individual’s information cannot be accessed by a third party.
The Mobility provided by android based system which is accessible on mobile through application are available on the go.
Thus the system will:
    • Enable any individual legitimate to be a blood donor to donate blood during the moment of need. This will reduced the complexity of registration thus more donor will be interested. This will increase reliability of blood bank services both during emergencies and at distance locations.
    • Allow user to ask for blood from reliable donors via an SMS.
    • Will gives chance to those who are willing to help during the moment of need. Donor may be motivated by physically involving in saving patients life, thus increasing motivation.
    • Automatically send notification to the donor when the time for the next donation is approaching. Furthermore, when blood bank run short of certain blood type, the application can find several donors to refresh the supply.
    • Disseminate important information about blood donation and how individuals can cooperate in saving other’s lives. Policies based on facts and findings that can be reviewed and commented over by global users. This will not only help to increase the rate of spread of information on the important of donating blood but also create continuous connection between blood bank and future donors. As a result, number of donors may increase with not much effort.
